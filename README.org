#+TITLE: XMMS2 sync

Xmms2-sync is a way to sync your mobile music player with you xmms
collection. It's designed for CLI, and for people that have either a
too big music collection or a too small mobile music player.

you could run it as
#+name: runing-it
#+begin_src sh
  xmms2-sync -e ~/Music /media/musicplayer/Music rating>2
#+end_src

which mean
 - -e :: encode the filename for old filesystem (fat32...)
 - ~/Music :: The first path is where your music collection is. It
              will be stripped from the filename before putting the
              file in the music player
 - /media/musicplayer/Music :: The second path is where you want the
      music to be coped. *unknown file will be deleted*
 - rating>2 :: pattern describing song to be copied

Beware: *This will remove file in /media/musicplayer/Music*.

If you want to know what will be done before doing it, add /-n/ to the
command line.

Useful other option are
 - -n :: do nothing, just print what would be done
 - -o :: do nothing, just print the size of the collection (will it fit?)
